In 2008, the US Bureau of Reclamation and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request by the Secretary of the Interior, received an independent review of the Central Valley Improvement Act (Listen to the River, 2008). That report addressed four objectives:

* improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs and implementation actions to achieve the fish restoration goals of the Act;
* enhance the agenciesâ€™ ability to learn from and optimize program actions;
* improve the transparency and accountability of the fish restoration programs to management, stakeholders, and the public; and
* by achieving the first three objectives, enhance public understanding and support for the program and continuing restoration activities.

To address these objectives, the Bureau and the Service adopted a Structured Decision Making (SDM) process. SDM provides a formal, documented, open, and transparent process to develop quantifiable and measurable objectives and determine the best decision alternatives to achieve restoration through the use of quantitative models. Decision models represent how actions would improve natural production for all four runs of Chinook salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon.

Development of the models was guided by an inter-agency, multi-stakeholder group of scientists and resource experts called the Science Integration Team (SIT). The models represent the current snapshot of the best collective understanding of population effects on anadromous fish in the Central Valley, and are subject to revision and refinement as that understanding improves. Reclamation and the Service seek broad support and buy-in for resource decisions by using the SIT models to prioritize restoration fund expenditures.

This web-tool is part of an ongoing effort by the SIT to encourage participation in the SDM process by improving effectiveness and efficiency; enhancing understanding of the system; improving transparency; and building public support for the program through better understanding.
